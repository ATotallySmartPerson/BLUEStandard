# Title of your BIP

## Preamble

    BIP: <to be assigned>
    Author: <list of authors' names and optionally, email addresses>
    Type: <Standard Track | Informational | Meta>
    Status: Draft
    Created: <date created on, in ISO 8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format>
    Requires (*optional): <BIP number(s)>
    Replaces (*optional): <BIP number(s)>

The title should be 36 characters or less.

## Simple Summary
"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the BIP.

## Abstract
A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.

## Motivation
The motivation is critical for BIPs that want to change the BLUE standard. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the BIP solves. BIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.

## Implementation
The implementations must be completed before any BIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the BIP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.
